# AI Racing Game
Get immersed in this 3D racing game where you compete against a Reinforcement Learning agent. The game is built in [Unity](https://unity.com), and the agent is trained with the [ML-Agents](https://unity.com/products/machine-learning-agents) library. Game assets come from [this](https://kenney.nl/assets/racing-kit) AssetPack, and the car controller is inspired by [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqATTzJmFDY) Youtube tutorial.
